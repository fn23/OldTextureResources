				  <center><p><font color="orange"><i>Hi there! How are you doing on 
this fine day? Perhaps you remember me from those videos I made years 
ago, unless of course, you suffer from some form of long-term memory 
loss.<br><br>
Anyhow, I am Evan "racer445" Herbert, and I am here today to tell you a 
little something about texturing, and hey, maybe we can even create 
something while we're at it!</i></font><br><br>

I hate step by step tutorials, so I always try to teach a certain mindset in my tutoring instead.<br>
I find starting with some simple theory helps get people thinking.<br><br>

<img src="The%20Portfolio%20of%20Kevin%20%C3%98sterkilde_files/theory1.png" width="100%"><br><br>
I always find it fascinating when people try to make something close to a
 photo reference or a piece of concept art, and get a result that looks 
nothing like it, yet it "looks good" to them. Even more surprising to me
 is when their end result looks "good" to so many other people. Don't 
believe me? Raise your standards and hop on any game art forum... you'll
 quickly see what I mean.<br>
<br>
Why this happens is still partially a mystery to me, but my guess is 
that it's a combination of low standards, sugar-coated critique/praise, 
and in big part due to a lack of any <i>observational skill</i> from the artists or observers. When you learn to observe, you will see your errors and never make those same mistakes again.<br>
<br>
You'll see me using the skill of observation a lot throughout this 
tutorial, and I'll try my best to specifically highlight major moments. I
 had a whole lecture written, but since that was boring I decided you'd 
probably learn more if you just paid attention instead. You'll do that, 
right?<br>
<br>
"There is a lot more to texturing than you think. You need to have a 
keen  eye for shapes and design, you need to know traditional art 
theory, you  need to be great at observing and picking apart things, and
 you need to  know how to balance your shapes, among many other skills."

As an observationalist, you will learn that some things look natural, 
and some things look clearly fabricated. No, I am not thinking what you 
are thinking right now. You will also learn that natural things have 
structure, as opposed to made-up things which often appear as random. 
This next statement might not make sense to many people, but... noise 
does not have to look random!<br>
<br>
Let's say you are making something modern—gun furniture, modern 
electronics, car interiors—all things that use hard plastic materials. 
Materials similar to this:<br>
<br>
<img src="The%20Portfolio%20of%20Kevin%20%C3%98sterkilde_files/G36.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>

There's a bunch of noise in this gun's plastic material.<br>
The majority of artists would just use photoshop noise to emulate it, 
but that looks so artificial, and there are better options!<br>
<br>
<img src="The%20Portfolio%20of%20Kevin%20%C3%98sterkilde_files/noise_samples.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>

In this sample, we've got three Photoshop gaussian monochrome noise 
samples on the left, and three samples from assorted photographs on the 
right. The first Photoshop sample is 100%, and has the most variation of
 any of the Photoshop samples, but still looks completely random 
compared to any of the photos. The second example is what most people 
do. They say "I want all noise all the time" and crank the slider way 
up, which produces this overcontrasted nonsense with absolutely no 
variation. Don't do this, please. The third option, 15%, is the most 
sparse of the bunch. It's essentially black with the occasional bright 
speckle, and it's similar to an inverse version of the 400% sample.<br>
<br>
Now the three photo options I chose. The first is sparse, great for 
specular only applications. The second is pulled off a metal photo, so 
it's great for worn down metal in the specular. The third is my favorite
 though, and it's what I use all the time for plastics. Sure, it's not 
the tiny scaled noise from the reference, but because it's larger, it 
reads better, so you can use less of it. All of the photo examples, 
however, have <i>structure</i> unlike the random photoshop noise. Just 
remember that the structured, natural option will always look better 
than any artificial emulation. That is why we pull directly from real 
life and don't just make what we think things look like!<br>
<br>
<img src="The%20Portfolio%20of%20Kevin%20%C3%98sterkilde_files/scratches.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>

One more example. On the left there are some scratches painted all old 
school style with a 1px brush, something many people still do for some 
reason. Looks completely random, right? Now on the right is an edited 
photo. There's so much more variation in the scratches, and everything 
looks like it happened for a reason. In other words: it has structure!<br>
<br>
"Exercise restraint if you ever feel the urge to noise up something, and
  as always; use your head! Everything is situational; there are no  
definitive answers to anything artsy!"
			
<img src="The%20Portfolio%20of%20Kevin%20%C3%98sterkilde_files/theory3.png" width="100%"><br><br>
There is a lot more to texturing than you think. You need to have a keen
 eye for shapes and design, you need to know traditional art theory, you
 need to be great at observing and picking apart things, and you need to
 know how to balance your shapes, among many other skills. It's never as
 simple as "make metal texture" or "make wood texture" like the people 
on those internet videos want you to think. You're going to hear me talk
 about shapes a lot when I make my texture, because I mean, when you 
don't have good shapes that are placed intelligently, the texture just 
will not be attractive no matter what you do. There's a lot of balancing
 involved in placing those shapes too, so the asset doesn't (or does) 
get weighted to one side, but I think the most important balance of all 
is the balance between high frequency noise and the large low frequency 
shapes.<br>
<br>
<img src="The%20Portfolio%20of%20Kevin%20%C3%98sterkilde_files/Freq.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>

This image illustrates the difference between high and low frequency 
shapes. Low frequency shapes are the big, broad shapes, whereas high 
frequency things are noisy and detailed. It's very very important to 
maintain a balance between these. You must have enough broad shapes to 
make surfaces easily readable, but enough details so the texture looks 
crisp and detailed.<br>
<br>
Many people aren't aware of this fine balance, and since they can't pick
 out and place good large shapes, they compensate with lots of high 
frequency noise. Someone has kindly donated some of their old art to 
demonstrate this common occurance. Thanks, duder!<br>
<br>
<img src="The%20Portfolio%20of%20Kevin%20%C3%98sterkilde_files/bad_art.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>

It's not readable by any means! Lots of people do this though to try and
 give plain areas interest, when in reality it simply doesn't read, and 
those areas would be better off as a spot where your eyes can rest. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, having all large shapes looks bland too if you're 
making realistic things, however some games—like TF2—use this as a 
stylistic choice, and with smart painting it can look great.<br>
<br>
<img src="The%20Portfolio%20of%20Kevin%20%C3%98sterkilde_files/tf2.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>

But since we're mainly making realistic items here, a balance is very 
important to keep if you want to maintain interest. Exercise restraint 
if you ever feel the urge to noise up something, and as always; use your
 head! Everything is situational; there are no definitive answers to 
anything artsy!<br>
<br>
There are many more essential art skills that are applied to texture 
art, I just find these are just the three most important/relevant ones, 
so I hope this inspires you to think more about them in more depth. <br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="The%20Portfolio%20of%20Kevin%20%C3%98sterkilde_files/preparation.png" width="100%"><br>
I've probably bored you enough with theory by now, so let's get ready to make something!<br>
<br>
<img src="The%20Portfolio%20of%20Kevin%20%C3%98sterkilde_files/SwordPlain.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>

This is the sword I want to texture for you. This is <i>not</i> from a 
reference, I designed it in my head and modeled it into what you see now
 in roughly an hour; a prime candidate for me to demonstrate things on. 
When I start into a project, I instantly get a vision in my head 
detailing exactly what I want the end result looking like... I can even 
rotate the object around in my head! Since I can't capture those voices 
in my mind, here's an image plotting out how I would like to texture 
this:<br>
<br>
<img src="The%20Portfolio%20of%20Kevin%20%C3%98sterkilde_files/SwordMockup.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>

You can see we have brass, brushed metal, paint on rough metal, that 
soft touch plastic every phone manufacturer uses these days, and a super
 special metal that I made up just for this purpose. Yes, I will show 
you how to make up believable materials, don't worry!<br>
<br>
Let's go over a material in more detail using our newly developed 
observational skills. When you take a closer look at reference photos of
 your material, it will tell you exactly how to texture everything. Yes,
 it really is that easy!<br>
<br>
<img src="The%20Portfolio%20of%20Kevin%20%C3%98sterkilde_files/MatsPlastic.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>

See how easy things are when you take a moment and think about what you're doing?<br>
We can even determine wear shapes from these photos.<br>
<br>
<img src="The%20Portfolio%20of%20Kevin%20%C3%98sterkilde_files/MatsPlasticDmg.jpg" width="100%"><br> <br>

See how easy it is once you learn to observe these things? When we apply
 this same thinking to all of the other materials we've chosen to make, 
models essentially texture themselves.<br>
<br>
Let's make our own material! Sometimes we need to make one up if real 
materials don't quite fit or look as good. If you're like me, you have a
 massive library of saved photos containing just surfaces and shapes 
which you use repeatedly as overlays for textures or as material 
reference. When you have this kind of library, apply a little common 
sense and it becomes very easy to modify and combine a couple of your 
saved materials to make something tailored to your specific needs. <br>
<br>
<img src="The%20Portfolio%20of%20Kevin%20%C3%98sterkilde_files/MakinMats.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>

For the blade, I've taken a bare steel and put a slightly yellowed 
protective coating on top of it. This separates it from the blued, 
heavily brushed metal on the handle, and allows for awesome chipped 
damage shapes on high impact areas. No, it's not perfectly realistic, 
but it's a believable material that will contrast well with the others 
ripped directly from real life. That said, don't just go making up 
materials all the time; only do it when you can't find a real one that 
fits, and only after you have put some serious thought into making your 
fictional surface.<br>
<br>
So, we have our model ready, and we have our materials planned out... Let's get to work!<br><br>
