This repo is intented to act as an archive for the older style of texturing in games, which typically involves a single diffuse texture, unlike the more modern PBR approach which involved three or more textures.

Much of the older content has been lost due to a loss of interest and is scattered among various forums, portfolios and websites. This repo intends to combine all this content and host it in a single location.
