This repo is intented to act as an archive for the older style of texturing in games, which typically involves a single diffuse texture, unlike the more modern PBR/Dynamic Texturing approach.

Much of the older content has been lost due to a loss of interest and is scattered among various forums, portfolios and websites. This repo intends to combine as much of this content and host it in a single location.
